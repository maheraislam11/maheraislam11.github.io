I am a 4th year undergraduate student studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at University of Dhaka.

I am interested in researching applications of causal machine learning techniques, particularly in signal processing and genomics. 

Currently, I am working on two machine learning research projects: one regarding antimicrobial resistance, and another in modelling the wearing-off syndromes of patients suffering from Parkinson's.

In my leisure time, I play board games, read books, and try to solve puzzles that make my head spin.
